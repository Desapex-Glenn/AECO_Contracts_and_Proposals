#### Proposal for [OpeningDesign's](http://openingdesign.com/) Architecture & Engineering Services

---
Hi Doug/Tisha, Thank you again for the opportunity!  As I mentioned on the phone (although I tailored it slightly to your project) the following is somewhat the standard proposal template that I send out to prospective clients.  

Of particular note, is the section called: **Fee & Workflow Proposal**.  There I outline our unique approach and how our fees are adjusted accordingly. 

---

#### Rough Scope...
Although a more nuanced list of requirements will undoubtedly unfold as the project evolves, so far, on a high-level, we understand that the project will include the following...

 - 6 bedrooms
 - swimming pool
 - approx. 3500sf
 - 1960's and/or industrial look and feel
 - exposed aggregate concrete floors throughout
 - site is a 3/4 acres

## Fee & Workflow Proposal		

Over the years, OpeningDesign has developed a preferred and unique way of working.  Although our website's [about page](http://openingdesign.com/about/) provides more detail, in a nutshell, most of our projects are [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and are conducted [out-in-the-open](http://openingdesign.com/about/).

Simply put, this way of working allows us to be more efficient, ultimately keeping costs down and bringing more value to our clients.  Having said that, we understand some clients, for whatever reason, may have hesitations regarding this approach.

To address your potential concerns, if any, we would like to offer the following (3) workflow and fee options:

 * **Approach (A): A Fully Open Approach** where the construction documentation, location, and the names of the parties involved in this contract are known and are shared publicly.  All newly created digital documentation/content is [open source](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), that is, will be freely available to any party for future use, assuming the terms such as [Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) and [ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) are honored.
 * **Approach (B): An Anonymous Open Approach** where all newly created documentation is shared publicly, however, the location and the names of the parties involved are kept anonymous.   Again, similar to approach (A), all newly created digital documentation/content is [open source](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
 * **Approach &#40;C): The Traditional Approach** where all documentation and parties involved remain confidential and private.

> - Please note, no matter which approach (A, B, or C) is used above...
> 	-  Any documentation from parties outside this contract, and/or shared with OpeningDesign **prior** to the signing of this contract, **WILL NOT** be shared publicly.
> 	- Any prior emails, or any emails between you, OpeningDesign, or any other parties during the duration of the project, **WILL NOT** be shared publicly.
> 	- Also, we will not make public anything that you explicitly indicates should be kept private.

### Not-to-Exceed Fee Proposal Options (**A**, **B**, or **C**):
---|---|\| |Approach| (A)|\| |Approach| (B)|\| |Approach|(C)|\| 
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
%|Phase|\| |%<br> Const. Costs|Not-To-Exceed|\| |%<br> Const. Costs|Not-To-Exceed|\| |%<br> Const. Costs|Not-To-Exceed|\| 
5.00%|**Phase 1:** <br>Programming|\| |0.40%|$2,000|\| |0.48%|$2,375|\| |0.55%|$2,750|\| 
10.00%|**Phase 2:**<br>Schematic Design|\| |0.80%|$4,000|\| |0.95%|$4,750|\| |1.10%|$5,500|\| 
25.00%|**Phase 3:**<br>Design Development|\| |2.00%|$10,000|\| |2.38%|$11,875|\| |2.75%|$13,750|\| 
35.00%|**Phase 4:**<br>Construction Documents|\| |2.80%|$14,000|\| |3.33%|$16,625|\| |3.85%|$19,250|\| 
5.00%|**Phase 5:**<br>Bidding & <br>Contract Negotiation|\| |0.40%|$2,000|\| |0.48%|$2,375|\| |0.55%|$2,750|\| 
20.00%|**Phase 6:**<br>Construction Administration|\| |1.60%|$8,000|\| |1.90%|$9,500|\| |2.20%|$11,000|\| 
|||||||||||
**100%**|**All Phases**|\| |8.00%|$40,000|\| |9.50%|$47,500|\| |11.00%|$55,000|\| 



*Assuming a Construction Cost =$500,000*

















> *Please note, these are not **lump sum** fees, but are instead, **not-to-exceed** fees.  If the project costs go down/up, or less/more scope is involved over time, these fee ceilings will adjust relatively. 
> 
> The **Hourly Rates**called out below (which are well below what we see currently in the market), will apply until this not-to-exceed fee is reached.
>
>By using hourly rates and a not-to-exceed fees based on percentages of construction, we have found this to be a win-win for both parties.  The design professionals are given a little more safeguard against potential [scope creep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep) and the client can realize more economical fees if they are able to make decisions quicker and more consistently--moving the design of the project along quicker.

### Hourly Rates

---

|-|Approach (A)|Approach (B)|Approach (C)|A Rough<br>Estimated<br>Percentage<br> of Fees
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** <br> [OpeningDesign](http://openingdesign.com)|
|Level 1 |$70/HR|$80/HR|$100/HR|65%|

|Level 6 |$85/HR|$85/HR|$85/HR|2%|
||||||
|**TOTAL**||||100%|


Additionally, the following list of consultants may be required during this project.  Their associated billing rates would be accounted for in the overall not-to-exceed fee.

* Specification Writer
* Door Hardware Consultant
* Lighting Consultant

*Consultant expenses will include an **additional 10%** to cover in-house administration, handling, financing, and insurance costs.*

### The Determination of the Not-to-Exceed Fee

For your reference and peace of mind, please review the following document as to what the standard practices are for establishing design fees in the construction/architecture industry.

[A Guide to Determining Appropriate Fees  for the Services of an Architect Consultants](http://www.mbarchitects.org/docs/guide_architectservicefees%28e%29.pdf).


We are confident that through our unique and open way of working and our strong band of collaborators and consultants, that that we will meet and exceed the industry standard of care.
