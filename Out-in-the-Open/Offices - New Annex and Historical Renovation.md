####Proposal for [OpeningDesign's](http://openingdesign.com/) Architecture and Historical Renovation Services

---
Thank you for the opportunity to submit our proposal for [Company Name]'s ([XXX]) proposed office renovation and expansion.  We are excited about the project and the potential of working together.

As we understand it, [XXX]'s new proposed office headquarters at [Address] will include: selective interior demolition and renovation of the existing structure and one-story annex, with the potential of an additional floor (new construction) above this annex.

Other than where new exterior construction will engage the existing structure, we understand there will be minimal exterior renovation of the existing structure.  We understand that your goal is to utilize the State of Wisconsin 20% Historic Tax Credit for Commercial Properties as part of this undertaking.  The structure is a City of Madison Landmark and as such, a Certificate of Appropriateness (COA) will be required for all exterior modifications.

The initial program, which is open to refinement as the project progresses, includes:

 - Breakroom
	 - north of annex to play into easy access to parking and trash 
	 - potentially used as a community meeting nook, verses just a servery.
<br>
<br>
 - Reception Area
	 - modest/efficient size
	 - coat closet
 - Coat Closet for employees
	 - size based on capacity
 - Supply Storage
	 - size based on need
 - Consolidated Restrooms
	 - unisex restroom with communal wash area
	 - mother's room
 - Work Enclaves
	 - 4-5 total- capacity for three persons per enclave
	 - acoustic privacy
 - (2) 6-8 person Conference Rooms
	 - utilize existing conference room
 - (1) Large 16-20 person Conference Room
	 - potential location at Northside of building
	 - direct exterior access
	 - wet bar
	 - ideally isolated from work areas to avoid distractions during large meetings
 - 8-10 Director Offices
	 - acoustic privacy
	 - large enough for 2-3 person meetings
	 - offices spread throughout to avoid perceived 'management wing'
 - 25-30 Workstations/Spaces
	 - combination of open/discreet
 - Other areas that may be necessary or are worth considering
	- elevator (will most likely be necessary)
	- copy/print Area
	- server/computer Room
	- mechanical/utility rooms

We understand the design and construction of the following scopes will be subcontracted through either the General Contractor, and/or [Company Name].   Per usual, however, OpeningDesign will work closely with the respective teams to make sure everyone's work is tightly coordinated.

* HVAC Engineering
* Electrical Engineering
* Plumbing Engineering
* Fire Protection
* Fire Alarm
* Security Systems
* Audio/Visual Consultant

The projected move-in date is August 2016.

The budget has yet to be determined.

###Fee & Workflow Proposal		

OpeningDesign has developed a preferred and unique way of working.  Although our website's [about page](http://openingdesign.com/about/) provides more detail, in a nutshell, most of our projects are [open source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and are conducted [out-in-the-open](http://openingdesign.com/about/).

Simply put, this way of working allows us to be more efficient, ultimately keeping costs down and bringing more value to our clients.  Having said that, we understand some clients may have hesitations regarding this approach.

To address [XXX]'s potential concerns, if any, we would like to propose the following workflow and fee options:

 * **Approach (A): A Fully Open Approach** where the construction documentation, location, and the names of the parties involved in this contract are known and are shared publicly.  All newly created documentation/content is [open source](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), that is, will be freely available to any party for future use, assuming the terms such as [Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) and [ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) are honored.
 * **Approach (B): An Anonymous Open Approach** where all newly created documentation is shared publicly, however, the location and the names of the parties involved are kept anonymous.   Again, similar to approach (A), all newly created documentation/content is [open source](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).
 * **Approach (C): The Traditional Approach** where all documentation and parties involved remain confidential and private.

*(Please note, no matter the approach used, any documentation from parties outside this contract and/or shared with OpeningDesign prior to the signing of this contract **will not** be shared publicly.  Also, we will not make public anything that [XXX] explicitly indicates should be kept private.)*

<br>
<br>

####Fee Proposal Options: Hourly rates with a not-to-exceed fee

|-|Approach (A)|Approach (B)|Approach (C)|Estimated Percentage of Fees|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** <br> [OpeningDesign](http://openingdesign.com)|
|Level 1 |$80/HR|$95/HR|$110/HR|53%|
|Level 2 | $65/HR|$80/HR|$95/HR|23%|
| **Historic Preservation Consultant**<br>[Preserve, LLC](http://www.preservellc.com/)|
|Level 1|$105/HR|$105/HR|$105/HR|5%|
|Level 2 | $75/HR|$75/HR|$75/HR|6%|
| **Structural Engineer Consultant**| 
|Level 1 |$170/HR|$170/HR|$170/HR|1%|
|Level 2 |$125/HR|$125/HR|$125/HR|2%|
|Level 3 |$100/HR|$100/HR|$100/HR|2%|
|Level 4 |$85/HR|$85/HR|$85/HR|6%|
|---|
|---|
|**Total Not-to-exceed Fee - a rough estimate** <br>(X% of construction costs - TBD, see below)| 7.5%(TBD)|8.5%(TBD)|9.5%(TBD)|100%


---

####The Determination of the Not-to-Exceed Fee

As is typical with the initial phases of a building project, the design is often too nebulous to determine a realistic lump-sum and/or not-to-exceed maximum fee.  In that light, we propose a two part fee contract whereby the first part will be an hourly rate proposal for approximately a fifth (1/5th) of the project's schedule--that is, the early 1)Programming and 2)Schematic Design phases of the project. 

For the second part, when the extent of the scope is better defined, we propose to continue with the proposed hourly fees, but amend the contract by adding a not-to-exceed maximum fee.  This fee will be a fixed percentage of final construction costs.

*For [XXX]'s reference and peace of mind, please review the following document as to what the standard practices are for establishing service fees in the construction/architecture industry.*

[A Guide to Determining Appropriate Fees  for the Services of an Architect Consultants](http://www.mbarchitects.org/docs/guide_architectservicefees%28e%29.pdf).
